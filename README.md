# C-Programming Repository

Welcome to the **C-Programming** repository! 🎉 This repository is a collection of C programs aimed at helping beginners learn the fundamentals of programming while exploring data structures and algorithms.

## 📚 Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is **learning**. It serves as a resource for beginners and enthusiasts to understand key programming concepts and dive into **Data Structures** using the C language.

## 📝 Content Description
- Beginner-friendly programs to get started with C.
- Implementations of essential **Data Structures** (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs).
- Popular algorithms for problem-solving and understanding computational logic.

## 🚀 How to Run the Programs
1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeWithAnkan/C-Programming.git
   ```
2. Open any of the `.c` files in your preferred IDE (e.g., [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Dev-C++, Code::Blocks).
3. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
   ```
4. Alternatively, use the built-in run options in your IDE.

## 📈 Future Updates
This repository is a work in progress! Plans for the future include:
- Adding more **Data Structures**.
- Implementing popular **algorithms** like sorting, searching, and graph traversal.
- Enhancing existing code with comments and documentation.

Stay tuned for more updates! 🌟
